These are sample scripts that show how to use Amazon Simple Email Service 
(Amazon SES) from the command line.  To learn more about these scripts, see 
the Amazon SES Developer Guide. 

PREREQUISITES
-------------
Before running these scripts, you must fulfill the following prerequisites:

* You must have an Amazon Web Services account, and must also sign up for 
  Amazon SES.  See the Amazon SES Getting Started Guide 
  for more information.

* You must install Perl version 5.6.0 or later.  If you already have Perl 
  installed, you can determine your version number by typing

      perl -v

  at the command prompt.  If you do not have Perl installed, go to 
  http://www.perl.org for more information.

* Depending on the version of Perl that you are using, you may need to install
  some additional Perl modules.  To install these modules, run the following
  commands:

      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Digest::SHA'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install URI::Escape'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Bundle::LWP'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install LWP::Protocol::https'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install MIME::Base64'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install Crypt::SSLeay'
      perl -MCPAN -e 'install XML::LibXML'

  Please ensure that you are using the latest versions of these modules.

INSTALLATION
------------
To install these scripts, copy them to a directory of your choice.  We suggest 
that you copy them to /opt/third-party/amazon/ses.  You might need 
administrative privileges to do this.

Help is available for these scripts - simply run one of them with the "--help"
parameter.  Here is an example:

      ses-get-stats.pl --help
      Usage:
         ses-get-stats.pl [--help] [-e URL] [-k FILE] [--verbose] -s | -q

For more information, please refer to the Amazon SES Developer Guide.

AWS CREDENTIALS FILE
--------------------
Each of these Amazon SES scripts requires an AWS credentials file.  To prepare 
an AWS credentials file, follow these instructions:

* Create a new text file.  In our example, we call it "aws-credentials".

* Go to http://aws.amazon.com and look up your AWS credentials:  Click on 
Account, and then Security Credentials.

* Copy your Access Key ID and Secret Access Key into the "aws-credentials" file.

* Change the permissions on the file so that only you have read/write access.
(This step is *very* important, because no one else should see your Secret 
Access Key.)

* Your credentials file should look similar to the following:
AWSAccessKeyId=022QF06E7MXBSH9DHM02
AWSSecretKey=kWcrlUX5JEDGM/LtmEENI/aVmYvHNif5zB+d9+ct

You can now use this AWS credentials file with the "-k" parameter when running
any of the Amazon SES scripts.  For example:

      ses-get-stats.pl -k aws-credentials -s

TROUBLESHOOTING
---------------

* Command not found:

      This means that your command line interpreter (or shell) cannot find the 
      script.  Try running it again with a fully qualified path name, such as:

         /opt/third-party/amazon/ses/bin/ses-send-email.pl 

      If you change your current working directory to this location, you can 
      run the script as follows:

         ./ses-send-email.pl

      Alternatively, you can include your current working directory in your 
      PATH variable, so that you can run the script without prepending "./". 

* /usr/bin/perl: bad interpreter: No such file or directory:

      By default, these scripts expect the Perl interpreter to be located at 
      "/usr/bin/perl".  If the Perl interpreter is installed elsewhere, or not
      installed at all, you will receive the error message printed above.  

      To correct this, you can edit the first line in the script so that it
      refers to your Perl installation (for example, /opt/third-party/bin/perl).
      You can also specify your Perl interpreter on the command line:

         /opt/third-party/bin/perl ./ses-send-email.pl

* Can't locate SES.pm in @INC:

      Each of the Amazon SES scripts require the "SES.pm" Perl module.  This
      error means that Perl could not find SES.pm in the list of directories 
      where Perl modules are located.  By default, the Amazon SES scripts 
      expect SES.pm to reside in the same directory as the scripts themselves.
      To correct this error, try one of the following:

      1) Before running the script, set the PERL5LIB variable to the directory
      where SES.pm is located.  For example:
         export PERL5LIB=/opt/third-party/amazon/ses

      2) Modify the scripts so that they can find SES.pm in the correct
      directory:
         use lib '/opt/third-party/amazon/ses';

      3) Use the "-I" command line switch to add the specified search path to 
      Perl's list of module directories:
         perl -I/opt/third-party/amazon/ses ./ses-send-email.pl
