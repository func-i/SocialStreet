SocialStreet

SocialStreet is a web app that makes it easy for people to plan/find and attend local events.

Initial Setup for Development:

- Download the source
- Setup a new config/database.yml file based on config/database.example.yml
- Setup a new config/secrets.yml file based on config/secrets.example.yml
  - For the secret keys, setup a Facebook app under your real/developer account: http://www.facebook.com/developers
  - Set the site URL to: http://localhost:3000/ (Site Domain can be left blank)
  - You can call it something like: SocialStreet-dev
  - You do not need to give other developers access to this app, since its just for your development sandbox
- Install PostgreSQL 8.3, 8.4 or 9
- Install the pg gem (might be a bit of a pain on OSX)
- Download and install Redis: http://redis.io/download
- Start Redis Server:
  - Open a terminal tab to the [REDIS_ROOT (where you extracted and installed it) dir, and run: ./src/redis-server
- Run 1 Resque Worker:
  - Open a terminal tab to the [APP_ROOT] dir, and run: QUEUE=* rake environment resque:work
- Start Resque Web Server (optional, for debugging):
  - Open a terminal tab to the [APP_ROOT] dir, and run: resque-web
  - This will start another web server here: http://localhost:5678/
  - This page should show 1 worker waiting for a job: http://0.0.0.0:5678/workers
- Start the SocialStreet App Server (duh):
  - Open a terminal tab to the [APP_ROOT] dir, and run: rails server
